# 3D Cube with Three.js

## Overview
This project showcases a 3D rotating cube created using Three.js. The cube features a texture displaying the text "made by Voltov" on all its sides. The scene is set up with ambient and point lighting to enhance the 3D effect.

## Technologies Used
- Three.js: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- HTML5 Canvas: Used for generating a dynamic texture with text.

## Features
- A 3D cube that rotates continuously.
- Custom text texture applied to each side of the cube.
- Responsive design that adapts to window resizing.
- Ambient and point lighting for a more realistic appearance.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (preferably Chrome or Firefox).
3. Ensure you have internet access to load the Three.js library from the CDN.

## Usage
- The cube will automatically rotate around its axes.
- The text "made by Voltov" is displayed on all sides of the cube.

## Customization
You can customize the following aspects of the project:
- **Text**: Modify the `createTextTexture` function to change the text displayed on the cube.
- **Colors**: Change the colors of the cube and background in the JavaScript code.
- **Lighting**: Adjust the lighting parameters for different visual effects.
